#Gnome Slideshows

I got tired of manually editing an xml file just to get a slideshow of
interesting background images in gnome, so I wrote a ruby script to do it for
me.


##Usage
* cp gnome-slideshow.rb to your images folder
* at the terminal: ruby gnome-slideshow.rb > backgrounds.xml
* open appearance settings in gnome and set backgrounds.xml as your background.
